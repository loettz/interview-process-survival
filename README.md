## Who this is made for :star:

Interview Processes - especially in the tech field, can be stressful. Many developers (not just juniors) fear them and are unsure how to prepare.
If this is you and you found this repo, I hope It will help. I went through several interview processes in my career, when I applied for
Junior, Mid-Level and Senior positions.

**This whole thing is from a web/frontend devs point of view and only reflects my experiences. Your experience may be different
than mine - if you want to add something in here, let me know**


## What to expect :heavy_plus_sign:

I will give you an [overview](0_OVERVIEW) about different interview stages, that may come with interview processes. How to prepare for them.
How to find useful resources and what [strategy](1_STRATEGY) may be useful based on your career stage.
I will also show you how you can use different experiences as a tool on your road to success.
You can also find some cheatsheets in here, that will give you an overview of topics to prepare for [interviews](5_INTERVIEW_PREP). 


## What you won't find in this repository :heavy_minus_sign:

I won't give explicit examples in datastructures and algorithms. 
I also won't go super deep into webdev technologies. 


## How to use this :raised_hands:

In the different directories you'll find a readme file with information on that topic.
You can use this as a guide and go step by step through the directories (topics are numbered, but no strict order)
or just look at a specific topic, that you want more information about.
Long story short: use this however it works for you :star:

If you are unsure where/how to start, go to [Overview](0_OVERVIEW)
