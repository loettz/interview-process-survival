## Contributing to Interview Process Survival :unicorn:

Hey you! I'm excited that you'd like to contribute to this project. 
Adding new perspectives, improvements and additional resources will make this project better
and will likely help more people who struggle with application processes.


## How your can help me to improve this project

+ Add your experiences
  You made experiences in interview processes yourself? Especially the perspective of Junior and Self-Taught developers
  is going to help a lot, because there are many people switching careers and trying to get into tech.

+ Add helpful [Resources :hammer:](/7_RESOURCES)
  You have some experience in interview prep? Great! Resources that you found helpful can be beneficial for others too.
  
+ Improve the docs
  I'm not a native english speaker, so typos or sentences that are poorly formulated can be found on this project.
  
+ Enhance the project structure
  You are a pro in writing markdown and you have ideas how to enhance the structure in this project? This will
  be super helpful for everyone who uses this because a clear structure will make it easier to navigate through the project.

:bulb: The most important thing is, that this project is meant to encourage and empower people, 
so if you think about making a contribution (yay :blush:): please try to avoid discouraging formulation.
Interview processes are hard enough, we don't want to put people down.
