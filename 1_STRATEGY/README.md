# 1. Strategy :chart_with_upwards_trend:

If you're just starting to apply, or if your applications didn't bring the results 
you were hoping for yet, it may help to set up or review your strategy.


## Why I believe a strategy is important :pray:

A strategy can be a time saver, makes your process a lot more efficient and gives you confidence through applying.
Applying is exhausting, and you don't want to waste time or energy.


## Important components of your strategy :pick:

### What do you want your next career step to be like?

Are you searching for a position with more experienced devs from whom you can learn or do you want to work in
a leading position or as a senior?
Are you seeking for more independence to get more confident in your job or are you
searching for a bigger team with lots of collaboration?
Which technologies do you want to work with?

### What kind of company do you want to work with?

Do you want to work in a big company or startup? Maybe something in between?
Do you prefer specific industries? Are you interested in working in an agency?

### Where do you want to work?

Are you searching for a job in your hometown or do you fancy working in a new city or even abroad?
Is a remote position something you are looking for or do you prefer having the opportunity to go
to an office?

### What's your salary expectation?

This depends on your working experience and also on location. Research salaries for your preferred location
and try to define a reasonable salary expectation based on that :money_with_wings:.
Keep in mind that salaries can also vary based on company size and other factors.

### What's something you don't want?

Knowing what you don't want is as important as knowing what you want. Think about your past working experiences, what was
good about it and what wasn't. What were things you wanted to change? :triangular_flag_on_post:	 What are red flags for you?

## How to know to how many jobs you should apply?

A lot of people only apply to Jobs where the tech stack is a 100% match. Don't let the tech stack in the job listing
discourage you. If you have a few matches in the stack (50% +-) it will be good enough to apply.

### Juniors

As a junior quantity matters a lot more than for a more experienced dev.
You don't need to apply to every single job you find, but I suggest you to apply even if:
+ you only know 30% of the tech stack
+ the job asks for 1-2 years of experience
+ the job is not 100% what you are looking for

It's harder in the beginning, and you need to do more research and possibly put in more effort than others.
[Interview](/5_INTERVIEW_PREP) experience will also help you a lot, so try to apply to lots of jobs to get interviews.

### Mid-Levels (1-2+ Years of experience)

Your first experience will make the job hunt a lot easier, but the [interviews](/5_INTERVIEW_PREP) 
and [coding challenges](/6_CODING_TASK_PREP) can also be harder.
Quantity isn't the most important thing anymore, but I would still suggest sending out a few more applications,
so you can compare jobs, get more interview experience, and you're prepared for comparing offers and dealing
with rejections.

### Senior (5+ Years of experience)

**Disclaimer:** most companies have an own definition of how many years of experience you need to be considered a senior.
As far as I noticed, more than 5 years is the most common definition.

If you have 5+ years of experience, you can be more picky with jobs you want to apply to. At the same time
this is not a guarantee to get every job – companies are picky too.
It can be useful for you to be extra sensitive with [research](/3_RESEARCH) before applying. Applying to more than
just one or two opportunities can still benefit you -> it gives you the chance to compare, choose and negotiate if you have 
a few offers on the table. Getting [interviews](/5_INTERVIEW_PREP) is a lot easier as a Senior, but the interviews
and [coding challenges](/6_CODING_TASK_PREP) will be more challenging. 
A company that wants to hire (and pay) a senior wants to be sure, that you can prove that you are a one.

## Build or use your Network

Your Network doesn't only consist of you ex colleagues and classmates. Do you know anyone
who works at a company that might has interesting job opportunities for you? Your best friends Mum,
your Aunts Dogs Hairdresser, someone from your sports club?

If there's a job offer out there that you like, and you have the opportunity to get a **referral**
this will increase your chance to get [interviewed](/5_INTERVIEW_PREP).
Especially for a junior a referral can make a big difference.

If you see a job listing with the recruiters name on it, you can try to find them on LinkedIn and reach out to them.
